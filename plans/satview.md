# SatView Plan

## Goal

Build a new optional module, `satview`, that gives Draxul a 3D overview of Earth and the objects orbiting it. The view should show:

- A rotatable, zoomable planet Earth.
- A visible day/night cycle.
- Satellite orbit tracks above the globe.
- Eventually, live or recently updated satellite positions and metadata.

The module should follow the existing module pattern used by `modules/megacity`: keep the terminal app free of source-level dependency on the module, gate the build behind a CMake option, and self-register the host provider from `app/main.cpp` only when enabled.

## Product Plan

### First Slice

The first usable slice is a visual host named `satview`:

- Launch via `--host satview`.
- Render inside the existing `IFrameContext::record_render_pass()` path.
- Use the shared 3D renderer abstractions instead of creating a second window or standalone renderer.
- Provide mouse drag rotation and mouse wheel zoom.
- Render a real Earth sphere, not a screen-facing billboard.
- Render synthetic orbit rings as a preview of the final satellite visualization.
- Keep Vulkan and Metal implementations in sync.

This slice is intentionally not a full orbital-mechanics implementation. It proves the host lifecycle, module wiring, shader staging, renderer depth path, and the basic visual language before introducing live data and larger CPU/GPU data flows.

### Full Feature Direction

The final version should turn the preview rings into a real catalog-driven orbital view:

- Fetch current orbital element sets for active Earth-orbiting objects.
- Cache the downloaded catalog and avoid frequent external requests.
- Propagate satellite positions locally so camera movement and time controls are instant.
- Draw orbit paths and current satellite markers.
- Filter by orbit class, owner/operator, object type, altitude, and search text.
- Show selected-object details such as name, catalog id, international designator, apogee/perigee, inclination, period, and element age.
- Support offline use from the last good cache.

## Data Source Plan

### Preferred Public Source: CelesTrak GP Data

CelesTrak exposes current General Perturbations data and supports query URLs such as:

```text
https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=active&FORMAT=json
https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=active&FORMAT=csv
https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=active&FORMAT=tle
```

Use JSON or CSV for the production path rather than legacy fixed-width TLE parsing where possible. CelesTrak explicitly notes that newer GP formats support 9-digit catalog numbers and avoid TLE-era fixed-field limitations. Also respect their update cadence and cache policy: active and Starlink group downloads should not be repeated more than once per update, and data is updated roughly every 2 hours.

Useful groups for staged rollout:

- `active` for the main catalog.
- `stations` for a tiny test set.
- `visual` or `brightest` for a user-friendly demo subset.
- `starlink`, `oneweb`, `gps-ops`, and similar groups for filtered views.

### Optional Authenticated Source: Space-Track

Space-Track is useful as a future authenticated source for more complete catalog data and historical queries. The implementation should treat it as optional because it requires credentials and terms-aware access.

Space-Track documentation points developers toward the `gp` and `gp_history` API classes for newer General Perturbations data. The older API class names tied to formats, such as `tle` and `tle_latest`, should not be the long-term foundation.

### Cache And Update Policy

- Never fetch satellite data on the render thread.
- Add a small data service owned by the SatView host or a module-local controller.
- Store the last successful catalog under the existing app cache/config conventions once those are identified.
- Use an age-based refresh policy, defaulting to no more than once every 2 hours for CelesTrak `active`.
- On network failure, keep rendering from the last cache and surface a non-blocking status string.
- Ship or generate a tiny built-in sample for smoke tests so rendering does not require network access.

## Orbit Math Plan

### Representation

Internally store each object as:

- Stable id: NORAD catalog id.
- Display fields: name, object type, country/operator if available, international designator.
- Element epoch and source age.
- Mean elements from GP/OMM/TLE.
- Derived orbit class: LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, debris/other.
- Last propagated ECI/ECEF position.
- Cached orbit polyline samples for the current time window.

### Propagation

Use a real SGP4 implementation rather than a hand-rolled approximation. The implementation options should be evaluated in this order:

1. Small permissively licensed C/C++ SGP4 implementation that can be vendored or fetched through CMake.
2. Existing space-data standards code if the dependency shape is reasonable.
3. A module-local minimal wrapper around a proven SGP4 source, with tests against known reference vectors.

The render path should receive already-propagated positions in Earth-centered coordinates. CPU propagation should run at a lower cadence than rendering, with interpolation if needed.

### Coordinate Frames

Start with a simple Earth-centered inertial approximation for orbit paths, then add Earth-fixed conversion:

1. Parse GP/OMM/TLE element set.
2. Propagate with SGP4 to TEME/ECI position.
3. Convert to Earth-fixed coordinates using UTC time and sidereal rotation.
4. Render positions against an Earth sphere whose texture surface uses the same Earth rotation model.

The first live-data milestone can tolerate a simple GMST conversion, but the implementation should isolate this math so better Earth orientation handling can be added later.

## Rendering Plan

### Module Shape

```text
modules/satview/
  CMakeLists.txt
  draxul-satview/
    CMakeLists.txt
    include/draxul/satview/satview_host.h
    src/satview_host.cpp
    src/satview_scene_pass.h
    src/satview_render_vk.cpp
    src/satview_render.mm
```

Host responsibilities:

- Own camera state, time controls, data-service state, and the scene pass.
- Convert viewport dimensions into view/projection matrices.
- Register the render pass each frame.
- Keep input handling platform-neutral.

Render pass responsibilities:

- Own backend-specific GPU pipeline state.
- Draw Earth.
- Draw orbit tracks and satellite markers.
- Respect `requires_main_depth_attachment()`.
- Keep Vulkan and Metal shader semantics aligned.

### Current Rendering Decisions

- Earth is generated as sphere geometry in the render pass and shaded by the Earth fragment shader.
- Earth shading now uses staged 8k equirectangular day, night, and cloud maps from Solar System Scope, with approximate sun lighting, ocean specular, cloud blend, and atmospheric rim.
- Orbit rings are procedural line lists in the shader for the preview.
- Vulkan uses SPIR-V shaders staged by the existing shader compile path.
- Metal uses `satview_scene.metal` compiled into a metallib by the existing Metal shader staging path.
- Earth texture assets are staged from `assets/satview/textures/` next to the executable and fall back to simple solid colors if missing.
- The renderer depth path must load existing color while clearing depth when a 3D custom pass runs after chrome/grid drawing.

### Scaling Direction

Synthetic rings are cheap, but real satellite rendering can involve many thousands of objects. The scalable target is:

- One CPU-side catalog vector.
- One GPU buffer for current satellite marker positions.
- One GPU buffer for orbit path vertices or a generated path texture/SSBO.
- Batched draws by orbit class or visual style.
- Optional level-of-detail controls to reduce orbit path density when zoomed out.

## Current Branch Notes

The initial MVP is implemented on `codex/satview-module-depth-fix` in commit `edd106e`:

- New `satview` module and host integration.
- Vulkan and Metal render paths.
- Texture-mapped Earth and preview orbit rings.
- Renderer depth fix needed for solid 3D surfaces in custom passes.

The next meaningful work item is Phase 4: consume the propagated SatView state in the renderer by replacing synthetic rings with catalog-derived tracks and satellite markers.

The first Phase 2 data slice is implemented after `e8ba39a`:

- Module-local satellite catalog records and orbit-class derivation.
- CelesTrak GP JSON parser for OMM keyword fields.
- Synthetic offline sample GP catalog loaded by the SatView host.
- Pane status now reports the loaded sample catalog object count.

The rest of Phase 2 is implemented after `67e2bb8`:

- `SatViewCatalogService` owns background CelesTrak `active` GP downloads through `curl`, so the render thread never blocks on network I/O.
- The service caches raw GP JSON and a metadata sidecar under the platform cache directory.
- Cache metadata records source URL, fetch time, object count, skipped records, and element epoch range.
- A two-hour refresh interval prevents repeated large downloads inside CelesTrak's GP update cadence; pressing `R` in SatView requests a manual refresh, but the service still keeps a fresh live/cache catalog instead of re-downloading inside that interval.
- If network fetch fails, SatView keeps rendering from live/cache/sample data and marks the status as failed instead of clearing the catalog.

Phase 3 is implemented in the current working tree:

- CMake fetches the pinned Vallado/CelesTrak AIAA-2006-6753 SGP4 archive when `DRAXUL_ENABLE_SATVIEW` is enabled.
- `satview_propagation` builds a compiled SGP4 model from CelesTrak GP records, parses UTC element epochs, and converts propagation output into TEME and approximate Earth-fixed coordinates.
- The propagator can produce current satellite positions plus configurable sampled track points for one orbit period or an explicit horizon.
- `SatViewHost` rebuilds the propagation model on catalog generation changes and updates an SGP4 snapshot on a one-second cadence separate from the render frame tick.
- Reference tests verify Vallado satellite 00005 position/velocity output and track sample generation.

The first Phase 4 rendering slice is implemented in the current working tree:

- `SatViewScenePass` accepts a dynamic vertex stream for propagated scene lines.
- `SatViewHost` builds orbit-class-colored track segments from SGP4 TEME samples and compact marker instances for current/bracketed satellite positions.
- Vulkan uploads track vertices and marker instances through separate mapped VMA vertex buffers; Metal mirrors the same split with separate shared buffers. Marker crosses are expanded in the shader, so camera-only redraws no longer rebuild marker vertices on the CPU.
- Metal uses the same vertex shape through a shared-storage `MTLBuffer` and the same line-list shader path.
- Synthetic shader-generated rings are removed from the SatView orbit shaders.
- The rest of Phase 4 adds a normalized object-kind model (`Payload`, `Rocket Body`, `Debris`, `Unknown`), optional object-type coloring, and UI LOD controls for track count, track sample count, and marker cap.
- Vulkan and Metal remain visually aligned because both backends consume the same CPU-built `SatViewSceneVertex` line-list stream with per-vertex colors; no backend-specific type-color shader fork was added.
- A path display mode now lets the panel show either all sampled paths or only the selected satellite path. The missing-path behavior was caused by the intentional path sampling cap: markers can be shown for all propagated satellites, but path polylines were only generated for the first `track_satellite_limit` catalog entries. The selected satellite is now sampled explicitly even when it is outside that general cap.

Phase 5 interaction and filtering is implemented in the current working tree:

- `SatViewHost` owns a pane-local ImGui context and renders a compact SatView control panel with pause, reset camera, refresh, time speed, filter, catalog, and selected-object sections.
- Host input is forwarded into that ImGui context first, so panel interaction does not rotate or zoom the globe.
- A testable `satview_filter` model filters propagated states/tracks by search text, orbit class, optional object type/classification, source label, and element age.
- The split track/marker streams now skip hidden satellites and brighten/enlarge the selected satellite marker and track.
- Click selection projects visible satellite markers to pane coordinates and picks the nearest marker within a small screen-space threshold.
- Selected-object details report object name, NORAD id, international designator, orbit class, optional type/classification, period, element age, altitude, and speed.
- Current public CelesTrak `active` GP records do not consistently expose object type or per-object source groups, so those filters are wired through the model and become useful as richer metadata is carried by future data sources.
