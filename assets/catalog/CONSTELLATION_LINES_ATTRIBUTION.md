Draxul converts the source Bright Star Catalogue chains into deduplicated pairs
of render-space unit directions. Bright Star Catalogue HR identifiers are
cross-referenced through HD identifiers to use the same Hipparcos astrometry as
the SatView starfield, with Bright Star Catalogue J2000 coordinates retained as
the fallback. The generated binary data remains available under CC BY 4.0.
Draxul's renderer code is not derived from the ConstellationLines project.

Constellation stick figures are interpretive and are not standardized by the
International Astronomical Union. This source can therefore use different
stars, branch points, or line topology from Stellarium's Modern sky culture and
other charts. Draxul preserves the selected source's segment topology; such
visual differences are expected and are distinct from the separately bundled
IAU constellation boundaries.
